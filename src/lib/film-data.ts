  { title: "Luv", image: "/images/film/1.jpg", description: "This short film is a collaborative project that we completed in just 48 days. It was a charity project for Christmas 2022, where every view on YouTube would result in “Gasma” donating a gift to orphanage kids. I took on multiple roles in this project, including Story, Director, Art Director, final layout, Modeling, lighting, rendering, animatic, color script, editor, colorist, pipeline arch, and poster designing. Our team consisted of seven members who worked on modeling characters, animation, textures, assets, environments, concept art, and end credits. This project is particularly special to me because it was created with the intention of giving gifts to orphanage kids. I invite you to watch the film and leave your comments." },

  { title: "WEDYE", image: "/images/film/3.jpg", description: "I have created a short film called 'WEDYE' during my free time, aiming to improve my animation skills. The film features a love story between two bouncing balls, and I have developed a sophisticated ball rig that allows for proper squash and stretch. To enhance the story, I have created a beautiful romantic environment. I used Blender for modeling, texturing, rigging, animation, lighting, and rendering, while Adobe Premiere Pro was used for editing and color grading. I hope you enjoy this cute and modern animated love story." },
  { title: "HOST", image: "/images/film/4.jpg", description: "This was my first collaborative project for my BA (Hons) in 3D Animation and VFX at Falmouth University. Our team consisted of five members, and we worked together for six months. Due to our limited team size, we divided the various job roles among ourselves. Throughout the project, I took on multiple responsibilities, including Art Direction, Rigging, Lighting, Color grading and character texturing. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we successfully completed the project. I am thrilled with our achievement and hope you all enjoy the final result." },
